# Shake Graphics Engine
Shake is a videogame and graphics engine for desktop development.  
It consumes lightweight dependencies, the STL, and OpenGL with SDL as the windowing layer.
The engine is in the beginning stages of becoming Linux portable, and has run on the iPhone in the past.

The engine currently supports:
* A Blender (.blend) model workflow
* Paths
* Forward Kinematic Animation
* Scenegraph
* Physics (beta)
* Particles
* Deferred Lighting
* Custom world topology.
* World editing.
* An Asset Library System (alpha)

Most systems are in the beginning, or beta stages of development.  The engine is purely experimental at this point, 
and would likely not facilitate creating any games further than the source code itself.

## Further Details
The current state of Shake is an experimental graphics engine.  The application does not
yet suport detailed game editing with object placement and a detailed asset system such as Unity and Godot, however
we are going to leverage Qt's user interface power to make this a possibility in the future.
