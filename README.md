# Bottle World
This is a game + engine that grew out of another game called 'Dwarf Conga'.  It grew into a dragon.  It is too complicated for its own good.  

But if you're interested in making games from sand then come read this monster of a program.  This is a simplified version of the Bro engine project.  If you want to literally die of reading code head over to the Bro_Vault project.


If you get lost don't panic, here at Bottle World, hugs are free.
