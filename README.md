# Bottle World
This is a game + engine that grew out of another game called 'Dwarf Conga'.  It grew into a dragon.  It is too complicated for its own good.  

But if you're interested in making games from sand then come read this monster of a program.

If you get lost in the code don't wrory, here at Bottle World, hugs are free.
