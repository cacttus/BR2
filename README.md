# BR2 Graphics Engine
BR2 is a videogame and graphics engine for desktop development.  It consumes lightweight dependencies, the STL, and OpenGL with SDL as the windowing layer. The engine is in the beginning stages of becoming Linux portable, and has run on the iPhone in the past.

# Systems
* A Blender (.blend) model workflow
* Paths
* Forward Kinematic Animation
* Scenegraph
* Physics (beta)
* An Gameobject and Component system.
* Particles
* Deferred Lighting
* Custom world topology.
* World editing.
* An Asset Library System (alpha)
* A *minimal* C# scripting engine.

# Development
Most systems are in the beginning, or beta stages of development.  The engine is purely experimental at this point, and would likely not facilitate creating any 
games further than integrating the source code itself.

The application does not yet suport detailed game editing with object placement and a detailed asset system such as Unity and Godot.
The development of this engine is dependent on the game outlined in the game design document.  Features that are currently being worked on will facilitate the world editor, and user interface
that will make phase 1 of this game possible.
