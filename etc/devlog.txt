Began simple port to Make and CMake with gcc.  Fix this in the future.  The one caveat here is still debugging with VS. 
VS allows a CMake project, but it doesn't appear as lightweight as a simple makefile.

**Previously we removed the custom app class instantiation in preparation for 
	1 - a scripting engine 
	2 - Multiple graphics windows 
	3 - Split window view (blender)

We converted Shake thus to its own EXE.  It's no longer a library.
